You turn 24 (basically, right now please)
    
    Dude, you're 24!! Welcome to your mid 20s!
        20-23 early 
        24-25 mid
        27-29 late

        I wouldn't say it's much different at 24, more responsibility as each adult year seems to add anyway. Regardless, you're going to rock it! I know it!

        The little bit is now in this letter. The little bit later is the rest. Open them when applicable. I hope they service you well this year. Transitioning out of college is hard, it's lonely, but remember, you're not alone. There's a whole line of people backing you!

        I love you! And I can't wait to see you flourish this year! 

You finish your first day on the new job

    Was it a long day? Was it just a "syllabus" type day? Do you feel like you drank from a firehose? Are you excited for tomorrow? Any emotions you are feeling at fully valid! This whole experience is exhilarating! How are you new coworkers? Remember exhilaration comes in bouts of excitment and terror.

    If you're feeling anxious over new responsibility, remember how capable you are! You've kept far more plates spinning than this. 
    If you're feeling anxious over new coworkers, Lauren, you're one of the most interactive and inviting people I've ever met! (Thank you for being so respectful and engaging!)
    If you're feeling beyond excited, remember everything is exciting. Thrive in that; however, recognize it will taper off. It doesn't mean you job sucks, it just means you have the next wave of intrigue to look forward to.
    If you're feeling content, amazing! I'm so happy.

    And if none of those feelings match, that's ok! Feel them! Embrace them & use them to move forward!

    This job is an incredible experience for a talented young woman! You have all the skills needed to succeed. WY and Maine taught you hard work and the technical prowess to get you started at the job. XO taught you patience and compassion for yourself and others. Your family and friends taught you the needs for community and close relationships that push you.

    ^ that is a winning combo! And you're off to a winning start! Don't let anyone (including yourself.) tell you otherwise!

You see me next in person - unlimited hugs

    HA! Have you seen me? Have you hugged me? HUG ME AGAIN! 

    I DARE YOU TO IT! DO IT!

    Actually, I challenge you to hug me as much as possible! This time we have together, you have permission to receive and give unlimited hugs! Enjoy the physical contact!

    Virtual hugs are no more!!! (though they are still very cute!)

You feel beautiful
    
    Girl you *are* beautiful! I can only imagine! Your hair is on point! Your make is flawless. and your clothing is perfectly matching. Beyond appearances, your heart love fiercely, your mind examines carefully, and your body embraces deeply! 

    Your beauty is in confidence as well. When you are confident, you are a sight to see! Beware world, you are a force to be reckoned with! 

    Maybe just strut to this today : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBmMU_iwe6U - beyonce.

You forget you're beautiful

    It's so hard to imagine you don't feel beautiful. But I know... emotions are complex, it's never as simple as it seems. But Lauren, you are radiant! Your smile is contagious. Try it smile at yourself in a mirror (or your phone camera.) See someone smiled back ;)! Your eyes are so expressive as you listen to others. 

    You stand tall, not just in physical height but also just posture wise. It's beautiful! Your hands are strong, with a strong grip, but their also gentle as they can caress cute baby puppies. Your gait is perfect as you walk with a purpose to admire your surroundings. 

You miss me

    Bro, I miss you too! Call me, even if it's seems like we've talked recently. Facetime me. Spam my texts. When you do, let's do a virtual meal together ok? Let's make something in the kitchen and eat it over facetime? Remember the nighttime mac and cheese? That was so great! Let's do it again!

You miss a person (not me) - call them

    Reach out to them! They miss you too! Long distance relationships are hard, and it takes effort to maintain. Even if it's just a small text, it'll make their day. Pinky promise.

    What are you waiting for? Go do it!

You require a quick boost of energy

    5 burpees.

    You read that correctly. Yes, you can hate me now.

    5 burpees. GO!

You're feeling impatient

    Who isn't? What an inconvenient emotion. Bleh... 

    Watch this video while you wait... it's better than waiting room soaps or phone line music.

You’re angry at me

    I'm sorry. Shall, I say it again, I'm so sorry! 

    Whatever I did or said, I'm a flipping idiot. You're mad at me and it's because I've hurt you, communicated poorly, or something wrong, or all of the above. Absolutely none of those are ok, and I'm so sorry.

    Lauren, I value your friendship so highly! And I will never do anything intentionally to jeopardize it. You challenge me in ways no else does and you love me so deeply! I'm so sorry that I've hurt you, and please forgive me! 

    Honestly, no matter what hurtful words came from my lips or hateful actions came from my body, I'm so sorry I let my rashness run away and I've angered you! Communicate with me please. I might be hardheaded, but given time to cool off, I will always put our friendship over my pride!

    Please give me 24hrs to cool off, and I'll realize the damage and fix it ok? Please forgive me. Love ya Lauren!

You’re angry (not at me)

    Whoever angered you, whatever angered you. Wow, they messed with the wrong person! Breathe! Take the time to bask in your anger. It's healthy to experience the full range of emotions - including anger. But then, breathe again. Look at the situation from other angles. Look at their perspective and your own. Hate to break it to you, but you're both probably wrong. Ideas are complicated and egos are fragile. Anger hurts both. 

    Your anger is powerful, but your forgiveness is just as powerful! It's soothing and healing to earn that. (I know... I've worked for your forgiveness before.) So take the time you need to seeth, but remember to forgive them ok? They'll need it ;) Allow forgiveness to sooth the wounds on egos and ideas and situations.

You're bored
    
    On the left side -- lauren_bridge picture.

    Remember this? We got bored one day and doddled on up to the bridge! What a day that was? Not only did we get great profile pics, we also experience true bliss. The windy couldn't stop the freedom of exploration. Our minds drifted away from the stress of school and responsibility. It was a chance to just hang out and be goof balls.

    Go find a friend and do this! Whereever you are! Drag Eilis out somewhere, grab a new friend you've made. Do anything with someone! Go have an adventure!

You’re anxious

    Stand up right now. If you're on your phone, stand up. If you're on your computer, stand up! Ok now finish read this and then go do something! 

    Paint anoher dikdik. Go for a walk and listen to an episode of How I Built This with Guy Raz <put a link here>. Paint flowers. Look up a spanish test and take it and see how well you can score.

    Do something that activates your brain and focuses your neurons away from whatever is causing the anxiety. You're incredibly creative! Use this anxiety to channel some fabulous ideas. Take inspiration from others and dream big. You can readdress you anxiety after you've given your brain a chance to thrive. :D

You’re stressed

    This week. You've got at least 4 hours free. Get off your phone & social media, stop watching netflix, tell people no, stop working. Whatever it is. Clear 4 hours.

    Those four hours are YOUR hours. 

    Just for you. Take a bath, try a new face mask, paint your nails, watch gilmore girls, nap. Whatever you want. Do that. 

    You control your time :D

You’re worried about me (or something dumb I've done)

    What did I do? I'm sorry I did that. Something I might do? Warn me against it! I do heed your warnings. Your opinions are great value to me, so please voice your concerns. You've do so before, and though I was a bit hurt and definitely defensive, it changed the trajectory of my life. Thank you! And as much as it's a burden on you, please confront me again.

    Thank you for caring for me so much to worry about me! I'm sorry I'm a childish idiot.

You need a reason to get out of bed
    
    Ah... Lauren. Beautiful, strong Lauren.

    Get up and out of bed right now and go look in the mirror. Do it! Yes... actually swing your legs over the bed. I'll be waiting.

    DUDE! Look! Will you look at that... you're out of the bed! Crushed it! First step down. Now look the gorgeous human in front of you. That's you! Remember who you are! Hard working, devoted, brave, passionate, thoughtful, rugged, and SO INCREDIBLY LOVED! I'm sorry today is so hard for you to get out of bed. But know people need you... I need you. Hannah needs you. Molly needs you. Eilis needs you. Pryce needs you. Taryn needs you. Avery needs you. Kath needs you. Ray needs you. And so many more! You provide so much value to each of our lives. I hope that's all the reason in the world you need to get out of bed today, and tomorrow and every day after that. We love ya dude! And we're thrilled to be living life with you!

You’ve forgotten how strong you are
    
    Oh Lauren, 

    How could you forget? You are so, so powerful beyond belief! You are tenacious and robust. You've got grit to endure difficult majors, incompetent and closed minded people, and seemingly impossible tasks. You've overcome shyness to flourish as a leader in a sorority of women who respected and loved you. You've run miles and pushed up your body from the ground; you've conquered tennis tournaments that were frankly pure insanity. And above all else, you've combined intellect and heart as you morphed into a beautiful woman! You are strong and competent. You are capable and powerful. 

    And you are never alone. There is a community behind you that supports you 100% and loves you unconditionally! Reach out, and we'll remind you of the power within!


You turn 25.
    
    You're old as FUCK!

    aka... a quarter of a century old. 

    Happy Birthday Ole Fart :P

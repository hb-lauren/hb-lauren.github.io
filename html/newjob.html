          Was it a long day? Was it just a "syllabus" type day? Do you feel like you drank from a firehose? Are you excited for tomorrow? Any emotions you are feeling at fully valid! This whole experience is exhilarating! How are you new coworkers? Remember exhilaration comes in bouts of excitment and terror.
          <br><br>
          If you're feeling anxious over new responsibility, remember how capable you are! You've kept far more plates spinning than this. <br>
          If you're feeling anxious over new coworkers, Lauren, you're one of the most interactive and inviting people I've ever met! (Thank you for being so respectful and engaging!) <br>
          If you're feeling beyond excited, remember everything is exciting. Thrive in that; however, recognize it will taper off. It doesn't mean you job sucks, it just means you have the next wave of intrigue to look forward to. <br>
          If you're feeling content, amazing! I'm so happy. <br>
          <br>
          And if none of those feelings match, that's ok! Feel them! Embrace them & use them to move forward!
          <br>
          This job is an incredible experience for a talented young woman! You have all the skills needed to succeed. WY and Maine taught you hard work and the technical prowess to get you started at the job. XO taught you patience and compassion for yourself and others. Your family and friends taught you the needs for community and close relationships that push you.
          <br>
          ^ that is a winning combo! And you're off to a winning start! Don't let anyone (including yourself.) tell you otherwise!
